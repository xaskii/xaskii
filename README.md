I'm a CS student in my final year at Carleton University. This summer, I worked on the Pyrefly (a Python static type checker and LSP) team, improving the internal notebooks experience at Meta.
Previously, I interned at Datadog, helping build out IAM and authentication for the web platform. Before that, I interned at Caseware, improving CI/CD, and other monorepo-specific tooling.

I'm pretty interested in programming languages, and writing Rust!
